## Freezing a TIER ðŸ¥¶

Triggering a code freeze is done by turning on the `code-freeze` feature flag found in the `smart-assistant` project. 

### Toggling LaunchDarkly Feature Flags in Slack
In the `phsdig.slack.com` workspace, the LaunchDarkly (LD) App had already been setup for us to toggle a specific LD flag to freeze a specific TIER.

## FAQ ðŸ™‹

<summary><b>Show Details</b></summary>

- **What if the code freeze is over and I want to merge my blocked PR?**
  - If the job failed due to the code freeze as seen in [What a code freeze looks like](#what-a-code-freeze-looks-like), navigate to the failed GH action run and rerun the failed job. If the code freeze is over, this should succeed.
- **Why is my PR blocked when we're not in a code freeze?**
    - The workflow is failing due to setup or an issue with the Python script. Checkout the logs and bring this up to the team if you need help troubleshooting.
    - The `code-freeze` LaunchDarkly flags were not toggled off to reflect the team's claim of a code freeze being over. There is currently no automation to the toggle of these flags, it is manual, even through Slack.
